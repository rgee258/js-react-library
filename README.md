# React Library

This repository contains a revisit of my previous library app written using vanilla JS. This time it's been simplified in appearance, but redone completely using React.

Check it out [here](https://rgee258.github.io/js-react-library/).

This project is done following The Odin Project, which can
be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/frameworks).

## Usage

To use the library, begin by pressing the Add Book button to open a form for a new book.
Supply the necessary information for the book, then press Add.
Now you have a book stored in your library!
You can now update your book's read status by pressing the Update button or remove it by pressing Delete.
That covers about everything that can be done with the library, so add as many books as you like.
